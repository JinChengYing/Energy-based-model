 Code of Energy-based model for MNIST datasets, based on [Tutorial 8: Deep Energy-Based Generative Models — UvA DL Notebooks v1.2 documentation](https://uvadlc-notebooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_notebooks/tutorial8/Deep_Energy_Models.html) . You can try to make it work on other tasks.

1.  Install necessary environment and tools based on requirements.txt

2.  Run train.py on MNIST datasets

3. Watch the train results in results package

4. You  can watch the training efficiency by running plot_training_curves.py.
